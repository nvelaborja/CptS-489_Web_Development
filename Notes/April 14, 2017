Storage API
	window.localStorage object
		instance of Storage object
	MDN status: REC
	Idea: Storage that persists after closing / leaving the page
		Uses a file system managed by the browser

	To store data: localStorage.setItem(keyName, keyValue);
		key name and value are expected to be strings
	Example
		localStorage.setItem("myData", "Some Value");
		var savedData = localStorage.getItem("myData");
		if (savedData) ...
	localStorage.clear();

Typed Arrays
	Standard in ES 6
	Much more like C/C++ arrays
		Can even simulate casting a pointer to a different type
	Wrap around ArrayBuffer object
		The ArrayBuffer object is used to represent a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer.
		Allocated with a size in bytes and does not change size after that
		No push, pop, or other operations

	C++ Code
		void* data = malloc(8);
		int* i32Arr = (int*)data;
		unsigned char* u8Arr = (unsigned char*)data;

	Equivalent JS
		var data = new ArrayBuffer(8);
		var i32Arr = new Int32Array(data);
		var u8Arr = new Uint8Array(data);

	i32Arr.length == 2
	u8Arr.length == 8

	i32Arr[0] = 17;

	u8Arr[0]   			17, 0, 0, 0 for least significant byte first  OR     0, 0, 0, 17 most significant byte first
	u8Arr[1]
	u8Arr[2]
	u8Arr[3]
