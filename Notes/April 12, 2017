Example APIs

	Battery API

		Purpose: get battery status
		MDN Stats: CR
		Supported On: Chrome (desktop and android) , FireFox
		BatteryManager object
			charging (Boolean)
			chargeTime (number)
			dischargingTime (number)
			level (number)
				0.0 - 1.0

			window.navigator.getBattery();
				returns a Promise object that can be used to get the BatteryManager

	Promise Object
		used for asynchronous computation. A Promise represents a value which may be available now, in the future, or never
		Many APIs access "system" functionality 
		User many not want to give browser access to these services / devices
		When promises are used in code, the user may be prompted by the browser to allow access
			Whenever the user decides, then the promise is resolved
		promiseObject.then function takes 2 functions as parameters
			first is the function to call if promise is fulfilled
			second is the function to call if promise is rejected


	Geolocation API

		Not fully finalized but seems to be supported currently on all major browsers
		Unlike the battery API:
			promises are not involved
			browsers WILL prompt for permission
			access through already instantiated object: navigator.geolocation

		PositionOptions object can be passed to getCurrentPosition and watchPosition
			enableHighAccuracy Boolean property
			timeout property
		More accurate location determination may take a lot of device power in comparison with the less accurate method
		Data stored is a sorted array of objects that have properties
			latitude (Number)
			longitude (Number)
			timestamp (Number)

		Simple App
			probably set accuracy to high
			leave it on as you walk/drive around campus/town
			Store the data for where you are every few seconds
				Storage API to be discussed next
			Analyze data to find our something interesting
				Algorithm to approximate percentage of paths traveled more than once
